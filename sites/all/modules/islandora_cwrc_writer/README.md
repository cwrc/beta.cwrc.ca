# Islandora CWRC-Writer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/discoverygarden/islandora_cwrc_writer.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/discoverygarden/islandora_cwrc_writer)

## Introduction

Provides a very minimal wrapper around the CWRC-Writer, so that it can be used in an islandora context.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora Rest](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_rest)
* [Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries)
* [CWRC-Writer](https://github.com/discoverygarden/CWRC-Writer)
* [jQuery Update](https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update) Version 1.8

jQuery Update is not a hard requirement but is necessary if you want to use the 
templates in the documents dialog box. octokit.js which is used to fetch the 
templates uses the global jQuery rather than using require.js to fetch the 
CWRC-Writer specific template.

CWRC-Writer is expected to be installed here:

* sites/all/libraries/CWRC-Writer (libraries directory may need to be created)

So far we've only tested up to [commit 7f96f78e77](http://github.com/discoverygarden/CWRC-Writer/tree/7f96f78e774a2594ae8c2a3550549b01022dcc3f)

### Java Servlet Configuration

CWRC-Writer depends on a number of Java Servlets to be functional.

* [cwrc-validator](https://github.com/cwrc/cwrc-validator)

Follow the instructions on the page, but also *rename* the generated war to
validator.war. In most cases your tomcat should exist here
_/usr/local/fedora/tomcat_.

### Reverse proxy config:

We make the assumption that we (reverse) proxy VIAF, to fix the same-origin
issue.

For Apache, with Drupal running on the same box as Apache, a couple lines like:

```
ProxyPass /viaf http://www.viaf.org/viaf
ProxyPassReverse /viaf http://www.viaf.org/viaf
```

To be able to validate documents, we require that the validator.war is deployed
to your tomcat directory, and that you set up a (reverse) proxy so that the
CWRC-Writer can communicate with it.

```
ProxyPass /cwrc/services/validator/ http://localhost:8080/validator/
ProxyPassReverse /cwrc/services/validator/ http://localhost:8080/validator/
```

To be able to access Geonames service you must set up a proxy with 
authentication: 

```
<Location /geonames>
   RequestHeader set Authorization "Basic XXXXX"
   ProxyPass http://apps.testing.cwrc.ca/cwrc-mtp/geonames/
   ProxyPassReverse http://apps.testing.cwrc.ca/cwrc-mtp/geonames/
</Location>
```

You'll need permission / authentication credentials from the 
CWRC organization. You can generation the credentials (replaces the XXXXX 
portion above) like so:

```
echo -n "username:password" | base64
```

In addition you must also enable mod_headers for the authentication 
credentials to be passed on to the CWRC Geonames service. With apache2 on 
Ubuntu this can be done like so:

```
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## To Do

* Look into integrating the [Geonames Service](http://github.com/cwrc/CWRC-Mapping-Timelines-Project/tree/master/geonames)
