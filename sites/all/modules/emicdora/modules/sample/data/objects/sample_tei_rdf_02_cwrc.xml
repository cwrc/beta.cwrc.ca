				<p part="N" xml:id="struct_3963">womanhood, when the fitness for motherhood crowns them, we
					coast Indians of the sunset country regard this occasion as one of extreme rejoicing,
					great honour and unspeakable gladness. The being who possesses the possibility of some day
					becoming a mother receives much honour in most nations, but to us, the Sunset Tribes of
					Redmen, she is almost sacred. So, when our girls reach womanhood, we make it a great
					occasion. The parents usually give a feast that lasts many days. The entire tribe is
					bidden to this festival. More than that, when a great Tyee (Chinook for chief) celebrates
					for his daughter, sometimes the tribes from far up the coast, from the far North, from
					inland, from the mountain passes, and the Cariboo Country, are bidden as guests to the
					feast. During these feast days the girl is placed in a high seat, an exalted position, for
					is she not marriageable? and does not marriage mean motherhood? and is not motherhood the
					most exalted position in the world? So we place the girl on a high elevation, for she must
					know and realize her responsibility, she must recognize that she is the greatest factor in
					the world, and she must sit in a high place as becomes her heritage as a woman, therefore
					as a possible mother, for this is the law of our people - we of the Sunset Tribes. It was
					years ago, hundreds of years - yes, thousands of years (the sweet old Klootchman
					pronounced it 'Tousen off yea-rs.' It was the only sentence of her quaint, broken English
					I was ever able to actually capture) - yes, more than thousands of years ago that the
					great Tyee of our tribe had two daughters, young, livable, and oh! very beautiful. They
					grew to womanhood the same time, and a mighty feast was to be given, such a feast as the
					Coast had never yet seen. The only shadow on the joy of it all was war, for the tribe of
					the great Tyee was at war with the Upper Coast Indians - those who lived north of what is
					now named by the white men the Port of Prince Rupert.'Giant war canoes fretted the entire
					coast line, war parties paddled their way up and down, war songs broke the silences of the
					nights, strife, hatred, vengeance festered everywhere, like sores on the surface of the
					earth. But the great Tyee snatched a week away from the bloodshed and battle, for he must
					make this feast in his daughter's honour, nor permit any mere enemy to come between him
					and the traditions of his race and household. So her turned deaf ears to their war songs,
					he ignored their insulting paddle-dips, which encroached within his own coast waters, and
					he prepared, as a great Tyee should, to celebrate in honour of his daughters.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3964">'But five suns before the feast these two maidens came to him, hand
					within hand. "Some day we may mother a man-child," they said, "a man-child who may grow to
					be just such a great Tyee as you are, oh, our father, and for this honour that may some
					day be ours, we have come to crave a favour of you."</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3965">'"What favour, children of mine, and of your mother? It is yours for
					the asking, this day," he answered.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3966">"Will you, for our sakes, invite the hostile tribe, the tribe you
					war upon, to our feast?" they asked.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3967">"To a peaceful feast, a feast in the honour of women?" he
					exclaimed.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3968">"So we would have it," they replied.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3969">"And so shall it be," he declared.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3970">"I can deny you nothing this day, and sometime your sons may be born
					to bless this peace you have asked, and to bless their mothers' sire for giving it."</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3971">'Then he turned to the young men of the tribe and said, "Build fires
					this night on all the coast headlines, fires of welcome. Go forth in your canoes, face the
					north, and greet the enemy, and tell them that I, the Tyee of the Capilanos, bid them join
					me for a feast in honour of my two daughters."</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3972">'And when the Northern tribes got the invitation they flocked down
					the coast to this feast of a great Peace. They brought their women and their children,
					they brought game and fish and o-lil-lie, as gifts. Never was such a Potlatch (a gift
					feast), never was such joyousness, such long, glad days, such soft, sweet nights. The war
					canoes were emptied of deadly weapons and filled with the daily catch of salmon. The
					hostile war songs ceased, and in their place were heard laughter and singing, and the
					play-games of the children of two tribes which had been until now ancient enemies, and a
					great and lasting brotherhood was sealed between them. The war songs were ended
					forever.'</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3973">The Klootchman's voice fell very low, and the last words were almost
					whispered.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3974">'And what of the two sweet daughters of the great Tyee?' I asked,
					slipping my hand in hers.</p>
				<p xml:id="struct_3975">'They are there,' she said, pointing to the twin peaks which rose
					far above us. 'The Great Spirit made them immortal. They will always be there in that high
					place. Their offspring now rule these tribes, for were not Peace and Brotherhood born of
					them? And there the two Sisters have stood these thousands of years, and will stand for
					thousands of years to come, guarding the Peace of the Pacific coast, and the serenity of
					the Capilano Canon.'</p>
